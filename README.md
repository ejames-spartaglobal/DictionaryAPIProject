# Dependencies

All dependencies for this project are already in the projects pom.xml file so none need to be added, however make sure they are imported in Maven and validated 

# How to run

To run the project's tests, go to the Tests Directory in the test package. From there go to TestObject and click on the green double arrow to run all the tests.

# Highlights

I feel like the highlight for my code is how I modularised my code to allow for easy reusability, scalability and maintainability within the project. The highlight for me however is how the code is able to test an 824 line JSON file 


# Areas of Improvement

I focussed on the "Happy" path and I feel I should have also done some tests on alternate paths where there are likely to be bugs.
